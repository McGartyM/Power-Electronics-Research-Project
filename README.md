# Power-Electronics-Research-Project
Research project report and presentation from EEE 5245.
The project looked at the set of nonidealities which influence the efficiency and design of the standard buck converter.
Several readily-available components and their parasitics were used to compute the theorical efficiency using these components.
Derivations including each nonideality are included. The report concludes with a short introduction of the synchronous buck converter.
